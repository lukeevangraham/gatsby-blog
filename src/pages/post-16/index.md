We started our full day in Lucerne by walking the iconic Chapel Bridge. &nbsp;The Swiss built this bridge in the 1300s as part of the city defense system. &nbsp;The window openings on the south side of the bridge are smaller to give defenders more cover. &nbsp;The north side of the bridge opens to the city.<br />
<br />
The bridge is decorated with artwork depicting the fishing townâ€™s history.<br />
<br />
We dressed in our Sunday best since we attended worship in the Jesuit church on the waterfront built in 1666. &nbsp;The service was entirely in German. &nbsp;Then we walked along the Reuss river. &nbsp;A spikey fence in the river maintains the water level of Lake Lucerne. &nbsp;Further downstream stands the Mill Bridge.<br />
<br />
The original train station burned down. &nbsp;Inside the new station notice the expensive Burger King combo for $10.<br />
<br />
Then we boarded a boat for a two-hour float on Lake Lucern. &nbsp;We saw beautiful homes and people playing on the lakeshore. &nbsp;The high alps beckoned in the distance, our destination for tomorrow. &nbsp;I wanted to get there and experience the high elevation change of pace.<br />
<br />
We headed back into Lucerne and walked the bridges at sunset. &nbsp;Then we walked on the lakefront at twilight before calling it a night.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for our next episode when we take in a smidge more of Lucerne before heading to the high alps and the Jungfrau region.
