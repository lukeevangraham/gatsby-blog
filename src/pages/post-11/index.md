>"Every time a man knocks on a brothel door, he is really searching for God." - G.K. Chesterton



In today's world many men have exchanged brothels for websites. Author Michael John Cusink believes that many men today are surfing for God.



In his book Surfing For God Cusink likens the brain to a field of tall grass. Our habits blaze trails through the grass that are easier to retrace later. Poor habits often become paths of least resistance we repeatedly tread. Cusink points out the importance of creating new habits and "letting grass regrow" in areas we want to avoid. 



He encourages men to embrace silence and solitude. Cusink also advocates working-out and hiking as ways of renewing our minds. 



I first heard about this book from Relevant Magazine when they posted an excerpt on their website. I so appreciated the excerpt that I acquired the book. 



I was profoundly encouraged by the book. It opened up opportunities to share Cusinks ideas with other men. 



I applaud Cusink for addressing an often taboo topic with directness. His ideas help me better respond to the temptations I encounter in our world.
