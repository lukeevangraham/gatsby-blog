In his book "Against All Odds" Chuck Norris emphasizes the importance of chasing after goals. Put simply he encourages us to set goals, visualize ourselves achieving them and then go for it.

Goals help us live intentionally. For 2010 I want to release three worship EPs. These music recordings will contain roughly six new original songs each.  I want each song to be usable for church worship gatherings.

Not all songs will be written by me. My mentor Marco Sassoon and other friends are helping me write songs. The project will represent different churches and vocalists.

By the time 2011 comes around I hope to have recorded 18 worship songs for churches to sing to God together. It's a lofty goal. Now it is time to visualize then do.
