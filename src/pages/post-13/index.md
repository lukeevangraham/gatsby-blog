With each new year I love to look back and identify favorite music from the previous year. &nbsp;I associate music with memories. &nbsp;So here is the list of music and memories from 2013.<br />
<p>

<p><strong>1. &nbsp;The 1975 - The 1975</strong>
</p></p>
<p>
An NPR music review introduced me to The 1975 and their self-titled debut album. &nbsp;The sound of the music fascinated me instantly. &nbsp;Lead singer Matt Healy's description of the album in the review caught my attention. &nbsp;They are a talented young band with a good grip on what music can be.</p>
<p>
<br /></p>
<p>
Healy explained the band's preference for groove allowed them to bypass the indie genre for mainstream pop. &nbsp;The songs Settle Down and Girls exemplify their aim at wide appeal. &nbsp;They also harken back to a sound from the 1980s. &nbsp;That sound is reminiscent and yet envelope pushing. &nbsp;Sign me up to buy their follow-up!</p>

<p> <strong>2. &nbsp;Justin Timberlake - The 20/20 Experience </strong>
</p></p>
<p>
I have been skeptical of Justin Timberlake for a long time. &nbsp;He has seemed talented. &nbsp;He impressed me with Rock Your Body years ago. &nbsp;His last album, the one with Sexy Back, turned me off because of his lyrics.</p>
<p>
<br /></p>
<p>
Then came his song Suit And Tie. &nbsp;He sounded more mature. &nbsp;He sang about monogamy.....What?! &nbsp;It was like Kanye West's career in reverse! &nbsp;Plus Suit And Tie had a creative sound. &nbsp;He fused a Big Band/Art Deco sound with modern Hip Hop.</p>
<p>
<br /></p>
<p>
Friends started raving about the album on Facebook. &nbsp;After giving it a couple listens he had me hooked. &nbsp;The album is visionary. &nbsp;He takes a song, and then flips it on it's head. &nbsp;It is a big budget production that justifies itself.</p>
<p>
<br /></p>

<p><strong>3. &nbsp;Washed Out - Paracosm</strong>
</p></p>
<p>
This was my album of the summer. &nbsp;I recently moved to San Diego. &nbsp;San Diego is a great place to enjoy a summer. &nbsp;This Washed Out Album is a perfect soundtrack for summertime drives. &nbsp;I drove all over SD with this album on loop. <br />
<br />
Songs like Don't Give Up and All I Know define musical chill. <br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>4. &nbsp;Amy Grant - How Mercy Looks From Here</strong>
</p><br />
<p>
I am biased towards Amy Grant. &nbsp;For almost my first two decades Amy was a huge musical influence in my life. &nbsp;(It's neither good nor bad. &nbsp;It just is.)<br />
<br />
Her newest release is mature. &nbsp;She's more thoughtful than in her 1990s queen of pop days. &nbsp;Her encouraging lyrics in Don't Try So Hard and Not Giving Up resemble therapeutic wisdom. <br />
<br />
I will associate this album with a couple trips to Imperial Beach when I felt burdened. &nbsp;The album and beach comforted me tremendously. &nbsp;Thanks Amy!<br /></p>
<br /></p>

<p><strong>5. &nbsp;John Mayer - Paradise Valley</strong>
</p><br /><p>
I thought John Mayer would have taken this year off. &nbsp;He steered his music in a new and western direction in 2012 with Born And Raised. &nbsp;Then he released Paradise Valley in 2013. &nbsp;Paradise Valley builds off Born and Raised's success.<br />
<br />
His duet with Katy Perry in Who You Loves shines as the best track on the album. &nbsp;His honesty in Dear Marie endears listeners. <br /></p>
<br /></p>

<p><strong>6. &nbsp;St. Lucia - When The Night</strong>
</p><br /><p>
This album exemplified the surge of synth rock in 2013. &nbsp;Synth rock has been picking up steam. &nbsp;We've seen the dance genre go synth for years and the Killers helped make strides in the rock genre. &nbsp;St. Lucia is really just one guy with a computer doing a terrific job of making exciting music.<br />
<br />
St. Lucia puts a fresh spin on the sound of 80's groups like Genesis. &nbsp;Songs like Closer Than This and All Eyes On You get me smiling.<br /></p>
<br /></p>

<p><strong>7. &nbsp;Phoenix - Bankrupt!</strong>
</p><br /><p>
It's fun to enjoy a band from France. &nbsp;Plus Phoenix! just knows how to make good sounding music. &nbsp;They exemplify the synth rock surge of 2013. &nbsp;Songs like Trying To Be Cool and Drakkar Noir keep my foot tapping and head bopping.</p></p>

2012 Leftovers</h2>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">
I admit I was late to the party on a couple great albums from 2012.

<p><strong>Bruno Mars - Unorthodox Jukebox</strong>
</p></p>
<p>
This album came out late in 2012. &nbsp;The song that got me hooked was Locked Out Of Heaven. &nbsp;Iâ€™m a sucker for a good groove and that song has it. &nbsp;My friend clued me in on the song Treasure which kept Bruno's tunes pumping through my car stereo a couple more months.

<p><strong>Fun. - Some Nights</strong>

This album was big in 2012. &nbsp;I was late to the party but spent much of early 2013 listening to it.
