We spent most of day nine in Europe exploring the Jungfrau on the opposite side of the valley from our hotel in Murren. &nbsp;To get there we cable carred down to Lauterbrunnen. &nbsp;Then we hopped on a train equipped with special teeth that grip a center rail for extra traction.<br />
<br />
The train first stopped in the resort town of Wengen. &nbsp;Then we climbed higher and higher up the Jungfrau.<br />
<br />
Jungfrau means mean young frauline or lady. &nbsp;The Jungfrau stands besides two other peaks. &nbsp;A Swiss fable says the Jungfrau is protected by a center peak called the Mönch or in English monk. &nbsp;This monk protects the Jungfrau from the Eiger (or in English ogre) on the opposite side of the Mönch.<br />
<br />
Also of note, we passed a Chinese couple taking their wedding pictures out on a ledge. &nbsp;Chinese couples frequently travel here for wedding photos even though their ceremonies takes place elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Then we switched trains at Kleine Scheidegg for a 30 minute climb up the Jungfrau. &nbsp;The train grinded below the Eiger and Monch until we stopped at the Jungfrau station.<br />
<br />
This complex in and on the mountain spans nine floors. &nbsp;Outside visitors gaze at an 11 mile long glacier. &nbsp;A restaurant on the other side of a hill serves coffee. &nbsp;Inside we viewed historical models of the complex, a Lindt chocolate exhibit, and the Ice Palace. &nbsp;The Swiss cut a hole in the glacier and named it the Ice Palace. &nbsp;They installed handbars and lights in the glacier walls so people like us can strut, spin and slide in comfort. <br />
<br />
Then we headed back down to Kleine Scheidegg. &nbsp;We lunched then hiked set out on a hike. &nbsp;The town of Gridelwald lay in the valley below. <br />
<br />
Cows clanged their bells in the distance below us. &nbsp;I wanted to get up close and personal with a cow. &nbsp;I found a path down to some cows nearby. &nbsp;A leader-cow I approached had no desire for a close human encounter. &nbsp;I walked a little closer and that cow advanced toward me pushing me away with it’s head. &nbsp;I got the message.<br />
<br />
Our hike ended at the Mannlichen cable car station. &nbsp;From there we headed down to Wengen, caught a train to Lauterbrunnen then ultimately returned to Mürren.<br />
<br />
It began to rain. &nbsp;We met up with my mom and had dinner across the road from our chalet. &nbsp;After dinner we hopped over to a nearby vista to savor the last moments of daylight.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for our next episode when we explore the Murren side of the valley. &nbsp;We’ll head up to a former James Bond movie set, hike to a waterfall and more.
