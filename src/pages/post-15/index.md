We left our hotel in Amboise early on the sixth day of our European vacation. &nbsp;We had a 5:30pm flight to catch from Paris’ to Switzerland. &nbsp;Before the airport we wanted to stop along the way in the city of Chartres. &nbsp;Chartres is a little town well known for one thing: it’s grand cathedral. &nbsp;The structure dominates the town.<br />
<br />
The labyrinth in the floor’s stone work impressed me. &nbsp;A priest sits inside a booth for people to speak and pray with. &nbsp;Outside on the back terrace the town of Chartres displays itself and another labyrinth in a terrace lawn. &nbsp;We walked around the cathedral’s ornate exterior.<br />
<br />
From Chartres we walked back to the car and drove to Paris’s airport. &nbsp;We caught our flight to Basel. &nbsp;This airport sits on the border of three nations. &nbsp;After we found the door for the Swiss exit we caught a bus to the Basel train station. The town is industrial and modern. &nbsp;At Basel’s train station we purchased our Swiss rail passes and boarded a train to Lucerne.<br />

We arrived in Lucerne around 10pm and hopped on a bus to our hotel. &nbsp;Then Carolyn and I went out for a walk to see the town at night. &nbsp;We walked the iconic Chapel bridge. &nbsp;It was Saturday night so we looked up service times for the Jesuit church on the waterfront. &nbsp;That leads us to our next episode with highlights from a full day in Lucerne.
