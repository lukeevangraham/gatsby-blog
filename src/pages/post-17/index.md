We began day eight of our European vacation at Lucern’s Lion Monument. &nbsp;This stone carving pays tribute to the Swiss guard who died protecting King Louis XVI during the French Revolution. &nbsp;The Swiss guard are known for their protective forces. &nbsp;Right by that monument is a tourist mecca with plenty of cowbell magnets for sale. <br />
<br />
Then Carolyn and I walked to the old city walls. &nbsp;We climbed up one of the towers for an elevated view of Lucerne. <br />
<br />
It was time to head to the train station and begin our journey to the high alps of the Berner Oberland. &nbsp;Our train zipped past lakes and mountains while heading to a transfer in Interlaken. &nbsp;Notably we passed lake Brienz where my parents vacationed decades before my time. <br />
<br />
I appreciated the design of the Swiss rail clocks displayed throughout their train stations. &nbsp;In Interlaken we transferred to the Berner Oberland Bahn that pushes into the Lauterbrunnen Valley. &nbsp;After a 15 minute ride we arrived in Lauterbrunnen. &nbsp;This train station provides view of waterfalls and massive cliffs. <br />
<br />
Across the street from the train station we hopped into a cable car. &nbsp;What a view! &nbsp;Our hotel rests on the edge of a cliff. &nbsp;After the cable car ride we transferred to a train at Stechelberg that grinds along the cliffs past cabins with valley views. &nbsp;We exited the train and walked to our chalet.<br />
<br />
We dropped off our bags and went out for a stroll around Mürren. &nbsp;Carolyn pointed out the native eldeweiss flower. &nbsp;The town furnicular ascends to the village of Allmendhubel. &nbsp;We watched clouds roll in in this valley of 72 waterfalls.
