The Voice is a new Bible translation from the Ecclesia Bible Society that connects more readers to the Bible through contemporary language.  Formatted as a daily reading Bible, The Voice features italicized text explaining ideas the original readers would have intuitively known.  The Voice also features a screenplay format for dialog-heavy portions that eliminates the redundant "he said" or "she said" throughout dialog.  Lastly the Voice also features in-text commentary notes and book introductions.



I greatly enjoyed reading The Voice translation.  The language reads easily as if it was written in 2012.  One of my favorite examples of that is Ephesians 4:28a which says "If you have been stealing, stop."  The Voice is contemporary like The Message translation but more succinct.  It feels like a cross between The New King James Version and The Message.

The italicized information that sheds light on what the original readers would have known intuitively is my favorite feature.  It is threaded seamlessly with the text and helps bring the words to life.



I plan on using The Voice as my primary New Testament because the updated language refreshes my perspective.  I enjoyed the ebook format.  I recommend this book for those who have had difficulty understanding the Bible in the past and want a more contemporary translation that doesn't read like a kids Bible.
