Years ago my friends and I shared a mentor who repeated a phrase we often mocked.  Her words “make good choices” achieved mantra status.  But years later this motherly sounding fix-all remains in our minds.

 That same phrase echos throughout Andy Stanley’s book The Principle of the Path.  In his book Stanley spells out the premise that our direction, not intention, determines our destination.

 This is a great book for self examination.  The early chapters challenged me to honestly uncover areas of my life I want to change.  Stanley challenged me to be brutally honest about why I do the things I do.  Then he asked me to write how I would advise someone else in my circumstances.

 Stanley also did a great job weaving together stories of Biblical characters who dealt with the direction their lives were heading.  King David of ancient Israel makes a few appearances and provides valuable lessons.  King Solomon, aka the wisest man who ever lived, also gets special treatment.

 I could not help but smirk when I read Stanley’s concluding words:  “choose wisely”.  Stanley reinforced the old mantra of “make good choices” that I suspected might be true.  I’m grateful Andy Stanley wrote The Principle of the Path to spell out that the direction we head in determines our destination.
