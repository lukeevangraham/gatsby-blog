Each January I enjoying asking "What musical releases were significant last year?  Here are my favorite albums from 2012.


**Bethel Live - For The Sake of the World** - 
Many describe this cd as mesmerizing. It's true. The layered instrumentation is unique, electric and brilliant. The songs are great and performances significant. The songs are intended for churches to use in their services. It's the most groundbreaking cd of the genre since at least Hillsong's A Beautiful Exchange (2010) album.

**John Mayer - Born and Raised** - 
John Mayer is an artist and his 2011 release Born And Raised continued to showcase his talent. This time he turned heads by showcasing a western vibe that really works. I love the pedal steel. His lyrics showed someone owning up to his flaws.

**The Killers - Battle Born** - 
The Killers surprised me. They had taken time off as a band after a disappointing previous release. Their new cd is their strongest ever. The lead singer wrote some incredibly vulnerable lyrics that endear listeners. I'm proud of them and consider Battle Born the most under-appreciated release of 2012. 

**Phil Wickham - Singalong 2** - 
Phil Wickham released a free live CD of him playing many of his well known worship songs.  The recording features him on acoustic guitar singing along with a room full of people that know his songs well.  They sing out confidently and inject so much life into this CD.  It was free and inspirational.  I find myself continually referring back to this recording.

**Foo Fighters - Wasting Light** - 
I purchased this as my first Foo Fighters CD knowing they are a great band worth listening to.  These guys practically define Rock and Roll.  The songs are great and so fun to turn up loud.  The band's creativity and passion continues to stand out.

**Honorable Mentions go to**:  Maroon 5 - Overexposed and Owl City - The Midsummer Station.
