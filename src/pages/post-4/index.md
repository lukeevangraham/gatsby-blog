How will you be remembered?  In “Outlive Your Life” author Max Lucado challenges readers to live unforgettably.  Lucado weaves Biblical stories of the early church with stories of current heroes inspiring us to think bigger than ourselves.

Just as the early church cared for orphans and widows of their day Lucado highlights the needs of the poor in our world.  He likens our world to a community of ten farmers with ten cows.  Our worldwide resources are distributed as if two farmers own eight cows leaving the other eight farmers left sharing two cows.  He challenges us to compassionately respond to the needy around us.

Lucado also used stories of the early church meeting in homes to inspire me to grow in neighborliness.  He challenged me to designate one meal a week as a “hospitality meal” and always plan on having people over.  Likewise he charged me to make a new rule for the next two months: no one sits alone.

Lucado’s inspiration to grow in compassion and hospitality hit home.  I hope to practice some of his ideas so when my days have passed my contribution to Jesus’ significance, not my own, may be worth remembering.
